# Firebase for Unity WebGL
Naive implementation of the most popular Firebase modules for Web apps and games made by Unity Engine.

## Features
- one settings file to setup Firebase environment, **no additional actions required**!
- **easy to use API** which similar to Firebase iOS/Android official plugin (with small differences).

## Which Firebase modules were included?
- [ ] Auth
- [x] Analytics
- [ ] Firestore
- [x] Messaging (limitations: no support for Service Worker 'onBackgroundMessage')
- [ ] Remote Config

I hope that I'll add other modules as soon as possible.

## What's inside?
- C# and JavaScript files
- `Newtonsoft.Json` library as a dependency [Runtime]
- `HtmlAgilityPack` library as a dependency [Editor]
